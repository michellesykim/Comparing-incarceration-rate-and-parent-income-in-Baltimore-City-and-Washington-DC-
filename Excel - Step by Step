-Baltimore-Incarceration Tab-
Open Excel file with the original incarceration data of all parent income in Baltimore
Sort out neighborhoods that end with Baltimore, MD - select the Name column and click Text to Column function. Then click comma and then freeze the top row and insert a filter. Then, for City column, just sort out the ones that contain Baltimore by using the filter function. 
Use Vlookup to combine incarceration rate fo 75th percentile parent income, 50th percentile, 25th percentile from other workbooks that contain the original data. I used the unique tract number to combine different data. 
Then, I calculated the min value by using the MIN function and max value using the MAX function and skewness by using the SKEW function
To make a histogram chart for the incarceration rate of 75th percentile, I first made a range on the left side, and used FREQUENCY function on the right side to figure out how many numbers of neighborhoods belong to each range of incarceration rate.  
Then I selected both range and number of neighborhoods columns and clicked Insert tab and clikced the column graph. Then I clicked the Chart Design tab, and and clicked Add Chart Element and added Axis titles and Chart Title
I followed the same steps for both 50th percentile and 25th percentile
Then for the combined linear graph, I selected the range and the number of neighborhoods column for 75th percentile and while I was pressing the command key, I would also select the number of neighborhoods columns for both 50th percentile and 25th percentile. Then I clicked Insert tab and click the line graph. Then I would also clikc the Add Chart Elements function to add title and axis titles. To change the legend names, I would have to double-click the graph and clikc select data and change the name there. 

-Washington, DC-Incarceration Tab- 
Open Excel file with the original incarceration data of all parent income in Washington, DC
Sort out neighborhoods that end with Washington, DC - select the Name column and click Text to Column function. Then click comma and then freeze the top row and insert a filter. Then, for City column, just sort out the ones that contain Washington by using the filter function. 
Then I followed the exact same steps as my Baltimore-Incarceration Tab

-Combined Linear Graph Tab-
First, I selected the range and the number of neighborhoods columns of 75th percentile parent income from Baltimore incarceration tab and also while pressing the commmand key, I would select the number of neighborhoods columns for both 50th and 25th percentile.
While still pressing the command key I would go to Washington, DC Incarceration tab
Then I would also select the number of neighborhoods columns for 75th, 50th, 25th percentile 
Then I copied those data and pasted on a new tab 
After I select the data that I pasted, I would click the Insert tab and click the linear graph
Then I would add title for the graph and axis titles by clicking the Add Chart Element under Chart Design tab
Then by double clicking each line graph, I would change the Dash Type and the color under Format Chart Area.

-Pivot Table Tab-
To make a pivot table, I would select the data in the Baltimore incarceration tab from tract number column to incarceration-25th percentile parent income column 
Then I would hit Pivot Table function under Insert tab and create a pivot table on a new worksheet
Then for Rows, I would put my neighborhood values and for values, I would put incarceration rate of all, 75th, 50th, 25th percentile 
Then by clicking the small i icon next to each value item, I would select the average value to change each item to average. 
I would follow the same steps for pivot table for Washington, DC except that I would select the range of data from the Washington, DC Incarceration tab
Then to make line graphs based on the pivot table data, I would select the top title row (only for 75th, 50th and 25th) and the grand total values for each respective column (75th,50th, and 25th)
And I would copy and paste the selected data on the right side and change the column title to simply just 75, 50, and 25
I would follow the same steps for Washington pivot table
After I copy and pasted both cities data, I would hit Insert tab and click Tables icon to make a table
Then I would select the first baltimore table (Not the pivot table) that I made and click Insert tab and click line graph
Then I had to click Switch Row/Column under Chart Design to make an appropriate chart 
And I followed the same steps to make a chart for Washington table
Then for both charts, I would Add Chart Element to add title and axis titles also to add data lables above each data point for the line graph
